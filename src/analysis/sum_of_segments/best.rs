//! Provides functionality for calculating the Sum of Best Segments for whole
//! [`Run`](crate::Run) or specific parts. The Sum of Best Segments is the fastest
//! time possible to complete a run of a category, based on information collected
//! from all the previous attempts. This often matches up with the sum of the
//! best segment times of all the segments, but that may not always be the case,
//! as skipped segments may introduce combined segments that may be faster than
//! the actual sum of their best segment times. The name is therefore a bit
//! misleading, but sticks around for historical reasons.
