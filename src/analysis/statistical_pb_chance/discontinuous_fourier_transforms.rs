/// Unlike the dirac delta function, when we consider the unit step function, we must note that due to
/// the cyclic nature of the time domain, our step function must contain both a step up and a step down.
/// The definition of the unit step function seen above contains only a step up. We must therefore
/// add two step functions using the above definitions to obtain a true step function
///
/// The unit step function returned by this function is initially 1, then steps down to zero at the point `time`
/// The step function must therefore step up between the last element of the array and the first element. i.e.
/// the index -0.5. For this reason. Thus, the fourier transform returned by this function yields:
///
/// ```latex
/// u[t+0.5] - u[t-t_{0}]
