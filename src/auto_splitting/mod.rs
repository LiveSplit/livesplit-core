//! The auto splitting module provides a runtime for running auto splitters that
//! can control the [`Timer`](crate::timing::Timer). These auto splitters are
//! provided as WebAssembly modules.
//!
//! # Requirements for the Auto Splitters
//!
//! The auto splitters must provide an `update` function with the following
//! signature:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn update() {}
//! ```
//!
//! This function is called periodically by the runtime at the configured tick
//! rate. The tick rate is 120 Hz by default, but can be changed by the auto
//! splitter.
//!
//! In addition the WebAssembly module is expected to export a memory called
//! `memory`.
//!
//! # API exposed to the Auto Splitters
//!
//! The following functions are provided to the auto splitters in the module
//! `env`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use core::num::NonZeroU64;
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct Address(pub u64);
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct NonZeroAddress(pub NonZeroU64);
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct Process(NonZeroU64);
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct ProcessId(u64);
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct SettingsMap(NonZeroU64);
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct SettingValue(NonZeroU64);
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct TimerState(u32);
//!
//! impl TimerState {
//!     /// The timer is not running.
//!     pub const NOT_RUNNING: Self = Self(0);

//!     pub const RUNNING: Self = Self(1);
//!     /// The timer started but got paused. This is separate from the game
//!     /// time being paused. Game time may even always be paused.
//!     pub const PAUSED: Self = Self(2);
//!     /// The timer has ended, but didn't get reset yet.
//!     pub const ENDED: Self = Self(3);
//! }
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct MemoryRangeFlags(NonZeroU64);
//!
//! impl MemoryRangeFlags {
//!     /// The memory range is readable.
//!     pub const READ: Self = Self(match NonZeroU64::new(1 << 1) { Some(v) => v, None => panic!() });
//!     /// The memory range is writable.
//!     pub const WRITE: Self = Self(match NonZeroU64::new(1 << 2) { Some(v) => v, None => panic!() });
//!     /// The memory range is executable.
//!     pub const EXECUTE: Self = Self(match NonZeroU64::new(1 << 3) { Some(v) => v, None => panic!() });
//!     /// The memory range has a file path.
//!     pub const PATH: Self = Self(match NonZeroU64::new(1 << 4) { Some(v) => v, None => panic!() });
//! }

//!
//! On top of the runtime's API, there's also WASI support. Considering WASI
//! itself is still in preview, the API is subject to change. Auto splitters
//! using WASI may need to be recompiled in the future. Limitations of the WASI
//! support:
//!
//! - `stdout` / `stderr` / `stdin` are unbound. Those streams currently do
//!   nothing.
//! - The file system is currently almost entirely empty. The host's file system
//!   is accessible through `/mnt`. It is entirely read-only. Windows paths are
//!   mapped to `/mnt/c`, `/mnt/d`, etc. to match WSL.
//! - There are no environment variables.
//! - There are no command line arguments.
//! - There is no networking.
//! - There is no threading.
