use crate::{platform::prelude::*, Time};

// We use a Vec here because a HashMap would require hashing the comparison and
// then comparing the comparison with the string at the index calculated from
// the hash. This means at least two full iterations over the string are
// necessary, with one of them being somewhat expensive due to the hashing. Most
// of the time, it is faster to just iterate over the few comparisons we have and
// compare them directly. Most will be rejected right away since the first byte
// doesn't even match, so in the end, you'll end up with less than two full
// iterations over the string. In addition, Personal Best will be the first
// comparison in the list most of the time, and that's the one we want to look
// up most often anyway.
//
// One additional reason for doing this is that the ahash that was calculated
// for the HashMap uses 128-bit multiplications, which regressed a lot in Rust
// 1.44 for targets where the `compiler-builtins` helpers were used.
// https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/73135
//
// We could potentially look into interning our comparisons in the future, which
// could yield even better performance.
