    // We can't use std's Instant as it's insufficiently specified. It neither
    // guarantees "real time" nor does it guarantee measuring "uptime" (the time
    // the OS has been awake rather than suspended), meaning that you can't
    // actually rely on it in practice. In livesplit-core we definitely want
    // real time rather than uptime. The problem in std is being tracked here:
    // https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/87906
    //
    // Various operating systems are problematic:
    //
    // # Linux, BSD and other Unixes
    //
    // POSIX intends for `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` to be real time, but this wasn't
    // correctly implemented in Linux and due to backwards compatibility
    // concerns they were never able to fix it properly. Thus `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
    // means uptime on Linux whereas on other Unixes it means real time (the BSD
    // family). So the solution is to use this on all operating systems that are
    // based on the Linux kernel.
    //
    // # macOS and iOS
    //
    // For macOS and iOS there is `mach_continuous_time` which does the right
    // thing, but is not recommended by the documentation. The documentation
    // recommends `clock_gettime_nsec_np(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW)` instead.
    //
    // # Windows
    //
    // On Windows std's Instant currently measures real time through
    // `QueryPerformanceCounter`, but we may need to use a custom implementation
    // for it as well in case this ever changes.
    //
    // # Fuchsia
    //
    // Fuchsia is based on the new Zircon kernel. It has two functions for
    // querying the time:
    //
    // zx_clock_get:
    // https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls/clock_get
    // zx_clock_get_monotonic:
    // https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls/clock_get_monotonic
    //
    // `zx_clock_get_monotonic` specifically calls out that it `does not adjust
    // during sleep` which seems to mean that it doesn't count the time the OS
    // is suspended. This is further evidenced by their libc implementation not
    // treating `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` differently and a bug ticket being linked
    // there:
    // https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/third_party/ulib/musl/src/time/clock_gettime.c;l=40;drc=35e7a15cb21e16f0705560e5812b7a045d42c8a5

    // # WASI

    // https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/5ab83a68d4eb4f218a898ed03b963b7393caaedc/phases/snapshot/docs.md#variant-cases
    //
    // WASI seems to underspecify its `monotonic` a bit, but says that it `is
    // defined as a clock measuring real time`, making it sound like a compliant
    // implementation should measure the time the OS is suspended as well.
    //
    // Open issue: https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-clocks/issues/47
    //
    // # Web
    //
    // In the web we use `performance.now()` which they want to specify as being
    // required to keep counting during any sort of suspends (including both the
    // tab and the OS). The browsers currently do however not implement this
    // correctly at all, due to all of the same issues that we are facing here.

    // # Final Notes
    //
    // We therefore need a custom implementation for all "Linux like operating
    // systems" as well as macOS and iOS. The following list has to match libc
    // (and our Cargo.toml):
    // https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/5632705fe1a7858d82609178ba96b13f98f8c2e6/src/unix/mod.rs#L1451-L1454
    //
    // We however remove emscripten from this list as it's not actually based on
    // the Linux kernel and instead has its own implementation in JavaScript
    // where it actually errors out on `CLOCK_BOOTTIME`:
    // https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/9bdb310b89472a0f4d64f36e4a79273d8dc7fa98/system/lib/libc/emscripten_time.c#L50-L57
