//! A Sum of Best Cleaner allows you to interactively remove potential issues in
//! the Segment History that lead to an inaccurate Sum of Best. If you skip a
//! split, whenever you get to the next split, the combined segment time might
//! be faster than the sum of the individual best segments. The Sum of Best
//! Cleaner will point out all of occurrences of this and allows you to delete
//! them individually if any of them seem wrong.
