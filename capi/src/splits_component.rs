//! The Splits Component is the main component for visualizing all the split
//! times. Each segment is shown in a tabular fashion showing the segment icon,
//! segment name, the delta compared to the chosen comparison, and the split
//! time. The list provides scrolling functionality, so not every segment needs
//! to be shown all the time.
