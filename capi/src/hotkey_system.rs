//! With a Hotkey System the runner can use hotkeys on their keyboard to control
//! the Timer. The hotkeys are global, so the application doesn't need to be in
//! focus. The behavior of the hotkeys depends on the platform and is stubbed
//! out on platforms that don't support hotkeys. You can turn off a Hotkey
//! System temporarily. By default the Hotkey System is activated.
