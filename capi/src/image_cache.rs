//! A cache for images that allows looking up images by their ID. The cache uses
//! a garbage collection algorithm to remove images that have not been visited
//! since the last garbage collection. Functions updating the cache usually
//! don't run the garbage collection themselves, so make sure to call `collect`
//! every now and then to remove unvisited images.
