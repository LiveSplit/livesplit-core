//! livesplit-auto-splitting is a library that provides a runtime for running
//! auto splitters that can control a speedrun timer. These auto splitters are
//! provided as WebAssembly modules.
//!
//! # Requirements for the Auto Splitters
//!
//! The auto splitters must provide an `update` function with the following
//! signature:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[no_mangle]
//! pub extern "C" fn update() {}
//! ```
//!
//! This function is called periodically by the runtime at the configured tick
//! rate. The tick rate is 120 Hz by default, but can be changed by the auto
//! splitter.
//!
//! In addition the WebAssembly module is expected to export a memory called
//! `memory`.
//!
//! # API exposed to the Auto Splitters
//!
//! The following functions are provided to the auto splitters in the module
//! `env`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use core::num::NonZeroU64;
//!
//! #[repr(transparent)]
//! pub struct Address(pub u64);

//! On top of the runtime's API, there's also WASI support. Considering WASI
//! itself is still in preview, the API is subject to change. Auto splitters
//! using WASI may need to be recompiled in the future. Limitations of the WASI
//! support:
//!
//! - `stdout` / `stderr` / `stdin` are unbound. Those streams currently do
//!   nothing.
//! - The file system is currently almost entirely empty. The host's file system
//!   is accessible through `/mnt`. It is entirely read-only. Windows paths are
//!   mapped to `/mnt/c`, `/mnt/d`, etc. to match WSL.
//! - There are no environment variables.
//! - There are no command line arguments.
//! - There is no networking.
//! - There is no threading.
